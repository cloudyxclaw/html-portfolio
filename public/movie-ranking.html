<p>This movie really hit home (in all the best ways possible, of course). Please, without revealing the essence of the movie, go watch it. It's so clever and definitely worth your time!</p>
<h3>Suzume no Tojimari</h3>

<p>Everything about it is super great, especially the art and animation. The music in the film is also outstanding, and I have a very fond memory of watching this anime movie with my close friends.</p>
<h3>Millennium Actress</h3>

<p>It's been a while since I've watched it, but Millunnium Actress really blew me out of the water the first time I did. The director was so clever with the scene cuts and the general plot and ideas of the movie, and though the film is quite old, I really enjoyed the animation and art design. I would definitely watch it again in the future.</p>
